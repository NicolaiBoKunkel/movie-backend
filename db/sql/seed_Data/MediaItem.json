Perhaps taking this message a bit too seriously, Pete decides it's his goal for the summer to help someone get into heaven; having been told that Catholicism is the only sure path to the kingdom of the Lord, Pete decides to convert a Jew to Catholicism in order to improve their standing in the afterlife. Hoping to find a likely candidate, Pete begins visiting a nearby synagogue, where he gets to know Rabbi Jacobson, who responds to Pete's barrage of questions with good humor. Pete also makes friends with the Rabbi's son, Danny, who is about the same age; when he learns that Danny is seriously ill, he decides Danny would be an excellent choice for conversion.",

After the war, the poets live and work together with Coleridge's wife, Sara (Samantha Morton), and Wordsworth's sister, Dorothy (Emily Woof). At first this communal arrangement works to the advantage of Coleridge--who does some of his best writing while Wordsworth stagnates--until Coleridge becomes addicted to opium. Wordsworth, meanwhile, doesn't find his voice until he abandons his friend. In 20th-century vernacular, Wordsworth is the yuppie, Coleridge the hippie.",

Maximus is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key advisor to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death.",

To do so, they examine things such as a drop of water, explosions, gunshots, ballet dancing, cornflour, shallow water diving, X games and sometimes some uncanny things like piercing one's cheek or standing on blades.\n\nThe high speed cameras are used at as low as 500 frame/second for capturing how dogs drink to as high as 40,000 frame/second for capturing bullets, breaking glass, etc. Speeds above 20,000 frame/second are shot in black and white as the data for lightness and darkness is reduced when there is no color value to shoot. This is because the recording is digital and so the frame rate is limited to a certain data rate and black and white footage is much smaller than full color.",

At the age of seven he was captivated by Carl Orff's Carmina Burana. 60 years and 25 bands later, including The Police, the spell is still strong, but why? How does music ignite that excitement? In this three part series, Stewart explores how music brings people together, moves them, binds them, communicates stories like no other art form. Why is it that music has seemingly transcendental powers that enable us to escape and connect with our Gods? Stewart travels the world meeting composers, musicians, filmmakers, DJs and scientists to ask the question, how does music work?",

Later it was also reduced to about 3 hours for theatrical and DVD release. The screenplay was the result of eight years' work by Peter Brook, Jean-Claude Carrière and Marie-Hélène Estienne. For the casting an international selection of actors was intentionally chosen, to show that the nature of the Indian epic is the story of all humanity.",

      "overview": "Open Mike with Mike Bullard was a Canadian late-night talk show which was broadcast live from 1997 to 2003 on CTV and on The Comedy Network in primetime. It was hosted by comedian Mike Bullard and initially taped at a studio at the back of Wayne Gretzky's restaurant in Toronto, Ontario before CTV moved the show to Toronto's historic Masonic Temple. Open Mike with Mike Bullard featured two or three panel guests and one musical or comedy performance nightly. The show's bandleader and musical director was Orin Isaacs. Part of Bullard's comedic style was interacting with audience members during his opening monologue, often deriving humour from finding ways to poke fun at an audience member's expense.\n\nIn the summer of 2003, Bullard's contract with CTV expired. He did not like their practice of shutting the show down for summers; he knew that it interrupted his exposure and he did not like to see reruns that were dated. He arranged and signed a multi-year deal to start a new, similar show on Global called The Mike Bullard Show. The new show retained many of the people and sketches from Open Mike, but CTV had replaced his show by carrying The Daily Show with Jon Stewart in his old time slot. The Mike Bullard Show was no match for that competition, and his show was cancelled in 2004 after only 13 weeks. Bullard's multi-year contract with Global prevented him from working elsewhere at that time, so he ended up with no exposure at all for a long time.",

      "overview": "Rocketship 7 was a children's television series that aired weekday mornings on WKBW-TV in Buffalo, New York from 1962 to 1978 and from 1992 to 1993.\n\nThe host of the show was Dave Thomas, who had joined WKBW in 1961. Promo the Robot was the show's other main on-air character. The person inside Promo the Robot was, for several years, Johnny Banazak. Rocketship 7 featured segments with Thomas and Promo along with cartoons and other short programs such as Davey and Goliath, and Gumby. Thomas left the station in 1978 to join WPVI in Philadelphia, where he assumed the name \"Dave Roberts\". When Roberts left, WKBW canceled Rocketship 7.\n\nWhen The Commander Tom Show was cancelled in 1991, WKBW decided to continue the \"Commander Tom\" character of Tom Jolls by reviving Rocketship 7 as a weekly Saturday morning series. Airing at 7 AM, Captain Mike Randall assumed hosting duties for this version of the show with his sidekick, Yeoman Bob, with Commander Tom Jolls, Promo the Robot, and Captain Comic making guest appearances.\n\nAccording to a recent Facebook post by Mike Randall, \"In January 1992 The NEW Rocketship 7 debuted on WKBW-TV IN Buffalo, NY. Created & Written by Bob Stilson. The Show Starred Mike Randall as Captain Mike, Bob Stilson as Yoeman Bob, Tom Jolls as Commander Tom, John Di Sciullo as Mr. Lucky, Charlie Mikolajczyk as Admiral Promo The Robot, Kathy Randall As Thema Louise.\"",

It explained how both space and time were flexible - and how the Universe was made of a four-dimensional fabric called space-time. This single idea gave us a new way to understand the force of gravity, explained how the stars were born and introduced us to the concept of the big bang. And, in the hands of Stephen Hawking, it allowed us to understand the most extreme monsters in the Universe - black holes. This two-part BBC documentary explores how two of the most famous scientists of the 20th Century transformed our understanding of the Universe - thus changing the world.",

Most shorts were from The Golden Age of American animation. Each of the three shorts focused on a common theme. Most shorts came from Warner Bros., MGM, and Paramount, but during the show's first season Cartoon Alley featured shorts from the Gaumont Film Company. Many recognizable characters have been featured in at least one episode such as Bugs Bunny, Popeye, Porky Pig, Tom and Jerry, and others not so famous such as Goopy Geer and The Captain and the Kids. The shorts often appeared uncut and uncensored, and the more controversial cartoons were often introduced with a brief warning by Mankiewicz about the ethnic stereotypes being portrayed. The network's logo was only featured for a brief time, usually during the last short featured.\n\nFrom November 2004 to September 2005 the series was featured just once a month but after popular demand the series became a weekly feature. This series never aired in February because of TCM's 31 Days of Oscars programming. The series was canceled in autumn of 2007.",

The 5 pounds have to cover food, accommodation and travel; the 5 pounds reflecting an average hourly wage, according to the Department of Trade and Industry in the U.K.. Leon had certain cities he had to pass through and was only ever allowed to stay for 24 hours in each city. The 5 pounds could not roll over and had to be spent. He was presented a new five pound note for each new day. The public could buy him things and he could work for goods, but was never allowed to be given money directly.\n\nBefore Leon had done the U.K. version, he traveled in America on $5 a day, starting in Times Square, New York and finishing at the Hollywood Sign, Los Angeles.\n\nAmazing Adventures of a Nobody has been shown on numerous Television Channels including Sky3, Sky Travel, Life One, Extreme Sports Channel & Fox Reality Channel.\n\nAs of June 2009, a European version in which Logothetis travels from Paris, France all the way to Moscow, Russia on €5 a day was aired on Dave and was repeated on Blighty.",

But if the kid’s story is not pure fantasy, it would be truly criminal to ignore it. The little boy’s memories are fading. If he is telling the truth, will he never grow up to be the adult he should have become? Will he finally be forced to accept the unthinkable and allow himself to be raised by a woman who may have abducted him?",

A similar show was Donald's Quack Attack. The show premiered on March 1, 1992 and was made to replace Good Morning, Mickey!. A show identical to this show called \"Mickey Mouse & Friends\" premiered on 1994. It wasn't possible to know what episode was going to be shown on any given day, but the show did feature showings of some shorts that don't show up on The Ink and Paint Club along with some shorts made by the Fleischer brothers, and clips from the animated features, such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Dumbo, Cinderella, and Alice in Wonderland. In 1999, the show was replaced by Mickey Mouse Works, later given a plot as House of Mouse. In between each cartoon, a short segment featured a small clip of a Mickey Mouse cartoon, accompanied by the Mouse Tracks logo. This show ran on The Disney Channel from 1992 to 2000, and on Toon Disney from 1998 to 2002. Finding footage of this show is very rare.",

      "overview": "Goodness Gracious Me is a BBC English language sketch comedy show originally aired on BBC Radio 4 from 1996 to 1998 and later televised on BBC Two from 1998 to 2001. The ensemble cast were four British Indian actors, Sanjeev Bhaskar, Kulvinder Ghir, Meera Syal and Nina Wadia. The show explored the conflict and integration between traditional Indian culture and modern British life. Some sketches reversed the roles to view the British from an Indian perspective, and others poked fun at Indian stereotypes. In the television series most of the white characters were played by Dave Lamb and Fiona Allen; in the radio series those parts were played by the cast themselves.\n\nThe show's title and theme tune is a bhangra rearrangement of a hit comedy song of the same name. The original was performed by Peter Sellers and Sophia Loren reprising their characters from the 1960 film The Millionairess. The show's original working title was \"Peter Sellers is Dead\", but was changed because the cast generally liked Peter Sellers. In her 1996 novel Anita and Me, Syal had referred to British parodies of Asian speech as \"a goodness-gracious-me accent\".\n\nOne of the more famous sketches featured the cast \"going out for an English\" after a few lassis. They mispronounce the waiter's name, order the blandest thing on the menu and ask for twenty-four plates of chips. The sketch parodies often-drunk English people \"going out for an Indian\", ordering chicken phall and too many papadums. This sketch was voted the 6th Greatest Comedy Sketch on a Channel 4 list show.",

The show parodied both local and international shows and people like local news shows, telenovelas, variety shows, and others. Part of the cast had previously worked on Sálvese Quien Pueda on Telemundo Puerto Rico.\n\nThe show featured comedians Herbert Cruz, Ivonne Arriaga, Noris Joffre, Lizmarie Quintana, Abraham Martí, Ángel Figueroa, Edgardo \"El Bebo\" Adames and Carlos Ramírez. The show might be considered as an equivalent of MADtv, which both featured parodies and other comedy skits. As of approximately in Spring/Summer of 2007, Abraham Martí left the show to pursue music and acting opportunities in Spain and abroad. On May 13, 2009 the show broadcast its last episode due to no advertisement revenue to pay the actors. After a week of cancellation the TV Ilegal posse was now part of Radio Ilegal on Cadena Salsoul.\n\nTV Ilegal aired two specials broadcast in Telemundo on November 2011 and early 2012.\n\nTV Ilegal returned to television to Univision Puerto Rico starting on October 1st, 2012 on Noche Ilegal. Herbert Cruz, Lizmarie Quintana, Ivonne Arriaga, Abraham Martí and Ángel Figueroa return as part of the cast, but not Noris Joffre.",

The show starred Susan Petrie as Toby Mitchell, a teenage girl juggling her family life and her friendship with Quebec exchange student J. J. Roberge. The show also starred Arch McDonnell and Micki Moore as Toby's parents, and Peter Young as her younger brother Mark.\n\nAlthough the show aired during a period of great social change, the show was somewhat of a throwback to an earlier era, depicting Toby as relatively innocent and traditional. The Toronto Star described the show as \"Canada's own Gidget\". Petrie herself commented to the Star that \"Toby is supposed to be the perfect teenager. I'm not sure I believe her yet.... You know, I would like to tell it like it is. Toby is the type of girl who will go to college, marry the guy she meets in English 345, arrange flowers, be a good hostess — and raise more Tobys.\"\n\nThe show was not particularly successful, and was not renewed for a second season.",

Devitt and Towne had originally met as television stars who played married private investigators on a TV series called Two of Diamonds.\n\nThe show was frequently compared to the American series Moonlighting. In a direct nod to the comparison, one episode actually featured an encounter with a character who mistook Devitt and Towne for Bruce Willis and Cybill Shepherd.\n\nThe cast also included Roland Magdane, Geraint Wyn Davies and Tony Rosato. Campbell was also an occasional writer for the series.\n\nThe series aired on Global in Canada, and in a late night slot on CBS in the United States, as well as on the USA Network. It was one of several Canadian-produced drama series to air in the CBS Late Night block of crime dramas. Others included Adderly, Night Heat and Hot Shots.",

However, more than 15 different international versions of the program will continue to air in other countries. There has been no comment from FOX as to why Million Dollar Money Drop was cancelled, though there's speculation it was due to its initial low ratings.",

      "original_title": "This is NFL Films",
      "overview": "Much has been made of the Films style. Salon.com television critic Matt Zoller Seitz has called NFL Films \"the greatest in-house P.R. machine in pro sports history . . . an outfit that could make even a tedius stalemate seem as momentous as the battle for the Alamo.\"[5]\n\nNFL Films productions follow certain patterns. Film is mostly used, one camera is dedicated entirely to slow motion shots, microphones are present on the sidelines and near the field to pick up both the sounds of the games as well as the talk on the sidelines, and narrators with deep, powerful, baritone voices are preferred. Narrators have generally been from the Philadelphia metropolitan area, with well-known announcers such as Jefferson Kaye, Harry Kalas, John Facenda, Andy Musser, Jack Whitaker, William Woodson, and current announcer Scott Graham all having narrated NFL Films presentations at various points in time. J.K. Simmons was tapped to narrate the company's one-hour recap of the 16-0 regular season of the 2007 New England Patriots, while actor Burt Lancaster was tabbed for narrations during 1969. Burl Ives narrated the 1971 Washington Redskins highlight film.\n\nTeam-specific films such as year-in-review films have occasionally been narrated by broadcasters or personalities involved with the team in question. Examples include the 1985, 2000 and 2001 Oakland Raiders season reviews being narrated by actor and former Raiders player Carl Weathers. Former Giant Frank Gifford periodically narrated New York Giants season reviews (notably the company's throwback-themed 2013 season recap) until his death in 2015, and ex-Giants teammate Pat Summerall narrated highlight films for many teams until his death in 2013. New England Patriots play-by-play announcer Gil Santos narrated the year-in-review films of the 1974, 1976, and 1978 seasons, and New Orleans Saints films from their inception in 1967 through 1979 were narrated by Don Criqui, who called Saints games for the NFL on CBS in the team's early years, and radio announcers Al Wester and Wayne Mack.\n\nThe style has been called tight on the spiral, a reference to the frequently-used slow-motion shot of the spinning football as it travels from the quarterback's hand to the receiver. This shot usually consists of showing the quarterback throwing the football, then the camera zooming in to focus on the spinning ball, then, as the ball starts to descend, the camera zooms out, showing the end result of the ball traveling into the receiver's hands. NFL Films also dubs sound bites of local radio broadcasts over key plays, because radio announcers are typically more enthusiastic about their home teams than are network television broadcasters. In addition, NFL Films often uses multiple camera angles (with an emphasis on close-up shots that often exaggerate the speed of the players in real time). The company's films also employ muscular orchestral scores from a wide variety of musicians, notably Sam Spence, Johnny Pearson (whose \"Heavy Action\" became the theme for Monday Night Football) Frank Rothman, Ralph Dollimore, Udi Harpaz, Malcolm Lockyer, Jan Stoeckart (under his varied stage names such as Jack Trombey), Peter Reno, Paul Lewis, Prameela Tomashek, Dave Robidoux and Tom Hedden. The company's use of KPM Musichouse tracks also notably included Syd Dale; tracks include \"Malestrom\" for the company's 1968 Minnesota Vikings season highlight reel and also the psychedelic-flavored jazz track \"Artful Dodger\" on the film recap of Super Bowl V, specifically during the montage which shows Johnny Unitas' 75-yard touchdown pass to John Mackey which was tipped in flight by Eddie Hinton and Mel Renfro before bounding to Mackey.\n\nThe company also makes prolific use of footage of players and coaches in the locker room after the game. With these techniques NFL Films turns football games into events that mimic ballet, opera, and epic battle stories. Among the company's most famous creations is the poem and accompanying music cue \"The Autumn Wind\", which have become official themes for the Oakland Raiders.",

Cameras would follow the players around all week in Big Brother style, to see if the computer matched the right couples or if it was dead wrong.\n\nVoiced by Mark Little, the show featured student age participants, so involved a lot of snogging, fumbling, drinking and Brits behaving badly. The \"players\" were typically easy on the eye, and spent the week teasing each other but rarely actually hooking up for the cameras.\n\nAt the end of the week, the computer's matches are revealed to see if the couples paired off the way it predicted.",

The programme was filmed in and around the Maidstone television studios, where it was also set, with Bro & Bro having set up home in a film vault.\n\nThe wolves called each other \"Bro\" however their real names were never heard as there was always some noise which would mask whatever was being said by any person who was saying their names at the time.\n\nThe show replaced Rolf's Cartoon Club, and like the previous show, also showed cartoons, all from the Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies series, which ITV owned the rights to at the time, 2 shorts were shown each episode.\n\nBro and Bro were played by Don Austen and John Eccleston. Despite Eccleston's shoes being filled on the original What's Up Doc? by Dave Chapman, best known perhaps for playing Otis the Aardvark as well as multiple characters on Dick and Dom in Da Bungalow. Eccleston continued to perform his character for subsequent series of Wolf It!",
